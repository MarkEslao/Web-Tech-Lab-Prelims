		WELCOME TO OUR PAGE! 
			This website is dedicated to the advocacy work concerning environmental issues.
		
		Who We Are?
			Well, we are students of Saint Louis University currently taking up Bachelor of Science in Information
			Technology. 
			
			As you can see, the environment is being harmed. We must take control of the things that can cause all of these. 
				Water, air, soil are all being spoilt; plants and animals have been brought to extreme extinction.
			Every country is now affected, but most of us really don't notice it. 
				Climate change threatens to expose millions of people to hunger, drought, flooding and diseases.
			The key here is to challenge destruction to stop and repair all the damage that has already been done.
			
			Protecting the environment is very essential now. We must know how to take care of what belongs to us.
				We raise awareness and understanding of different practices that can probably contribute to environmental
				protection and poverty in developing countries.
		
		We must follow the rules and policies to prevent our home from collapsing. Encourage our people to clean and protect 
			the environment and save Mother Earth!
