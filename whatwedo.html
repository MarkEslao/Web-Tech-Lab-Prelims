		<br>God has blessed and given us a great nature. An amazing planet, a pretty plants and beautiful creatures to take care of, <br>but these days we have been abusing what has given to us. 
		<br>Because of us being selfish and also our vain, we want unique things to be ours just to brag without considering <br>its effect to our nature and without noticing that were losing everything. <br> We have been developing new things with the material that was made with our nature. <br>  We have been thoughtless in doing things like throwing trashes everywhere <br>specially in the ocean which affects the animals that lives in that area. <br> We are doing necessary things that hurts mother nature just to get what we want <br> and it hurts me to see and to think that maybe what this generations sees and experiences  <br> will not get to experience the next generation and that is depressing. 
		<br>


		We have to stop abusing things and start to take care of our nature specially those indigenous animals and plants.<br> We have to stop buying fur clothes, leather bags and shoes that we all know came from the skin of animals <br> that they have to kill just to build that product, imagine how many animals do they have to kill <br> just to make thousands of those products with different style, we have to stop throwing trashes anywhere specially in the ocean <br> because the creature is suffering, many sea creatures die because they have been eating plastics instead of foods. <br> They can not even swim freely these days because some fisherman are so greedy <br> and just throwing bombs just to fish without considering the corals dying. <br> We also need to stop cutting trees because it is the reason of floods every time there is a typhoon. <br> We need to plant more trees instead. We also need to stop burning plastics because it affects our ozone layer, <br> if the hole in the ozone layer gets worst, we cannot do anything about it anymore <br> so before it is too late we have to restore the green surroundings we had before, <br> treasure and take care of our mother nature like before.

		The world where we live in is the world we all have as a gift from God. All things in nature have its beauty in its own unique way. <br> The beauty that holds us in awe, we may never know when it really disappears and all sufferings may come and bestow us sorrow to what happens then. <br> Our own actions reflect the surroundings we are in, yet as we continue to do destruction because of our greedy souls, <br> trying to claim that we are the center of the world… Heed my words, fellow human. Things may come and go,<br> but if we continue to sought for such trivial matters, nothing will be left, <br>as nature can turn tables and erase us from here on. We must care for everything we take, we must give everything to make this environment of ours,<br> Mother Nature, live longer and healthier so that alongside with all of us humans… can live as well with her. The world depends on each of us. <br>Take a step, not so big, but little by little, as you can also help us save and preserve the nature’s beauty and wealth it has been providing us, <br>because I believe in you, dear fellow human, that you are also one of the saviors that can bring the life back to our world.<br></p>
